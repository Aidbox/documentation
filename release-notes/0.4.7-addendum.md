# 0.4.7 addendum

### createdAt \(cts\)

New column added to all resource tables - cts \(createdAt\) - time of resource creation. All CRUD operations respect this column, but we do not include automatic migration for this column because of performance reason. To set this column in a right value for existing data you have to run following statements manually on your box:

```sql
-- set cts to ts  - right value for created resources
update "patient" set cts = ts;

-- take cts for updated resources from history
update "patient" set cts = h.ts
FROM "patient_history" h
WHERE h.id = "patient".id and h.status = 'created';
```

Replace "patient" and "patient\_history" with lowercased name of resource types you want to update.
