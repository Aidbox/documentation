# Aidbox Notebooks

{% hint style="warning" %}
Aidbox notebooks is a beta. Please join [the discussion](https://github.com/Aidbox/Issues/discussions/412) or [contact](../../contact-us.md) us if you want to contribute.
{% endhint %}

A notebook is a single page where you can run code ([REST](../../api-1/api/), [SQL](../../modules-1/aidbox-search/usdpsql.md), [RPC](../../api-1/rpc-api.md)) check the output, and complement it with text. Using Aidbox notebook you can easily create custom scenarios with your Aidbox data, save it for later use or share it with your colleagues and the Aidbox community.

So now you can easily:

* create custom scenarios using different requests.
* share knowledge with your team and Aidbox community
* raise questions and report issues related to Aidbox

## **Functionality**

* REST, SQL, RPC Markdown support in cells
* [Notebook save ](notebooks.md#save-a-notebook)
* [Notebooks repository](notebooks.md#publish-notebook) - space for public notebook storage.
* [Notebook export/import ](notebooks.md#export-aidbox-notebook)
