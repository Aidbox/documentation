# Tutorials

Welcome to the Aidbox tutorials. These guides provide step-by-step instructions on how to use Aidbox. 

[Aidbox Product Line](https://www.health-samurai.io/aidbox) has a wide variety of solutions to fit for different requirements. For development purposes, it is recommended to use Devbox or Devbox in Cloud. 

Letâ€™s see what their features are.

#### Devbox in Cloud

* No setup required, just log in and click on the New Box button.
* Scalable and reliable infrastructure.
* Easy transition from development to production.

#### Devbox

* Can be installed and used locally.
* Has most of the features of other Aidbox products.

Even though there are some differences between these two products, most of the tutorials are suitable for both of them.
