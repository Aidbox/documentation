# Log analysis and visualization

## **Install** 

You may want to track logs in AidBox with Kibana, and Grafana. You can do anything from tracking query load to understanding the way requests flow through your apps.   


We prepared for you docker-compose.yaml file with Elastic search, Kibana and Grafana pre-configured. For log tracking, you only have to [pull this repository](https://github.com/Aidbox/devbox/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) and execute `make up` operation in your shell.   


Subsequently, please open the localhost address in the browser. You can look up the address in docker-compose.

## **Explore with Kibana**

Go to Aidbox log documentation \([Logging & Audit](https://docs.aidbox.app/core-modules/logging-and-audit)\). 

Logs schema available here with brief attribute description.

Using the listed attributes helps you to read REST logs in Elastic search filtering them type by type.
