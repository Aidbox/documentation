# Uploading Sample Data

## Endpoint for Bundles

Aidbox endpoint for bundles will be the base URL of your Box: `/` in Aidbox REST Console and `[base]` \(`https://<YOUR-BOX>.aidbox.app`\) in any other external client \(Postman for example\). Alternatively `/fhir` and `[base]/fhir` can be used, read more about [/fhir]() endpoints. 

## Bundle Example

According to the [FHIR specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction), bundle is a container for a collection of resources for transport and persistence purposes. Below is an example of request, which creates two patients:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```javascript
POST /fhir

{
  "resourceType": "bundle",
  "type": "transaction",
  "entry":
  [{
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "/Patient"
      },
      "resource": {
        "name": [{
            "given": ["Bob"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }, {
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "/Patient"
      },
      "resource": {
        "name": [{
            "given": ["Peter"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
```javascript
Status: 200

{
    "id": "64",
    "type": "transaction-response",
    "resourceType": "Bundle",
    "entry": [
        {
            "resource": {
                "name": [
                    {
                        "given": [
                            "Bob"
                        ]
                    }
                ],
                "id": "d1f48e05-220c-4d27-9d30-22df21f1b86b",
                "resourceType": "Patient",

                    "versionId": "64",
                    "tag": [
                        {
                            "system": "https://aidbox.io",
                            "code": "created"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "status": 201
        },
        {
            "resource": {
                "name": [
                    {
                        "given": [
                            "Peter"
                        ]
                    }
                ],
                "id": "49bcfa88-9915-4832-a763-1d60cb561cc3",
                "resourceType": "Patient",
                "meta": {
                    "lastUpdated": "2018-10-29T12:47:45.769Z",
                    "versionId": "64",
                    "tag": [
                        {
                            "system": "https://aidbox.io",
                            "code": "created"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "status": 201
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

[FHIR specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction) says that bundle should look like:

```javascript
{
  "resourceType": "bundle",
  "type": "transaction",
  "entry": [{
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/Patient"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

Every transaction bundle MUST have the **type** field which value can be **transaction** or **batch**, each element of`entry` field MUST has **method** and **url** fields in the `request`.

Bundles must be sent via POST method to BASE\_URL which is basically the URL of your Box for external clients and `/` or `/fhir` for REST Console \(actually hostname exists in REST Console, but it hidden\).

## Aidbox REST Console

1. Access your Box in Aidbox.Cloud.
2. Open REST Console.
3. Type in `POST /` or `POST /fhir`. \(read about [difference]() between Aidbox and FHIR\)
4. Leave next line empty.
5. Paste your bundle.
6. Press Ctrl+Enter or click the **Send** button.

This is a brief description about how to work with transactions and batches in [Aidbox](https://www.health-samurai.io/aidbox). More interesting information coming soon, stay tuned!

## Generating transaction bundle with Synthea \(advanced topic\)

Here's how we can install Synthea â€” [Synthetic Patient Population Simulator](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
./gradlew build check test
```

Generating the population one at a time...

```bash
./run_synthea -s 1000
ls output/fhir
```

...you should see few files with names similar to those:

```bash
hospitalInformation1537450368636.json 
Mckinley734_Johnston597_f25b9177-3c01-4d76-a48f-0a83affa5a56.json
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Make sure that you  use`POST /fhir`for synthea bundles, not just `POST /`**
{% endhint %}

Copy content of first file to REST Console, use `POST /fhir` to upload FHIR transaction bundle. Everything else is the same as in the previous step. After that, upload the content of the second file into Aidbox. That's all, you are awesome!
