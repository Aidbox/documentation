# Audit logging

## **What is audit logging?**

Audit logging is the process of recording events or activities that occur in a system or application. These logs serve as a formal record of actions taken, often for the purpose of analyzing, monitoring, or troubleshooting a system. Audit logs are particularly important in environments that require compliance with various regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Audit logs typically capture information such as:

* The identity of the user or device performing the action
* The action that was performed
* The date and time of the action
* The outcome of the action (success or failure)
* The source and destination involved in the action (e.g., IP addresses)
* The patient identifier involved in the action
* Any other data deemed necessary for auditing purposes

Depending on the system, these logs can be quite detailed, helping administrators trace back steps in a given process, understand user behaviors, or pinpoint issues in the system. These logs are usually secured to prevent tampering, and access to them is generally limited to authorized personnel to maintain their integrity and confidentiality.

## Why do i need it?

Audit logs in a healthcare application serve multiple critical functions, many of which are mandated by various regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States. Here are some reasons why audit logs are particularly essential in healthcare applications:

### Compliance Requirements

1. **Legal Compliance**: Regulations like HIPAA require healthcare providers to maintain detailed logs of who accessed what information, when, and what actions they took. Failure to comply can result in severe fines and penalties.
2. **Standard Adherence**: In addition to legal requirements, there may be industry standards that require the use of audit logs for quality and accountability.

### Security and Data Integrity

3. **Unauthorized Access**: Healthcare data is particularly sensitive. Audit logs can help you monitor for unauthorized access and take quick action.
4. **Tamper Evidence**: If data is altered or tampered with, audit logs can serve as evidence and can often help in identifying what was altered, when, and by whom.
5. **Incident Response**: In the event of a security incident, your audit logs are a critical resource for understanding the scope and nature of the breach. They help in forensic analysis and also in improving future security measures.

### Accountability and Traceability

6. **User Accountability**: Audit logs track the actions taken by individual users. This provides a level of accountability among staff and can be useful for resolving conflicts, investigating issues, or enforcing policies.

### Transparency and Trust

10. **Patient Trust**: Knowing that activities are logged and auditable helps build trust with patients, who are increasingly concerned about the privacy and security of their health information.
11. **Transparency with Auditors and Stakeholders**: Audit logs can be shared with external auditors, regulators, or other stakeholders (as appropriate) to demonstrate compliance and operational effectiveness.

## What Aidbox provides in case of audit logging?

### Aidbox as a source of audit events

When audit logging is enabled, Aidbox produces audit logs for significant events:

* FHIR CRUD & Search operations for basic FHIR resouces
* FHIR CRUD & Search operations for patient compartment FHIR resources
* \[WIP] Authentication & Authorization events (login, logout, SMART on FHIR authorization, etc)
* \[WIP] Security & configuration updates

Aidbox produces audit logs in conformance with [Basic Audit Log Patterns IG](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/).

### Aidbox as an Audit record repository

Aidbox acts as [Audit record repository](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-9.html#9.1.1.3) (ARR) for FHIR AuditEvent resources. Aidbox supports

* `POST /fhir/AuditEvent` to record events&#x20;
* `GET /fhir/AuditEvent` to receive them
