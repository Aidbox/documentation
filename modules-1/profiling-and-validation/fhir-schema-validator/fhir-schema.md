# FHIR Schema

FHIR Schema is a format designed to simplify the implementation and validation of FHIR resources. It is heavily inspired by the design of JSON Schema and introduces a more developer-friendly representation of FHIR StructureDefinitions.

## Key features of FHIR Schema include:

* _**Simplified Structure**_\
  FHIR Schema represents FHIR resources and their elements in a more straightforward and intuitive manner compared to FHIR StructureDefinition. Each element is represented as a property of the resource with its type specified directly. This representation is similar to how data structures are typically defined in programming languages.
* _**Nested Elements**_\
  FHIR Schema provides a clear and simple way to represent and validate nested elements in FHIR resources. This is a key requirement for many healthcare data use cases.
* _**First-class Arrays**_\
  Identify and label arrays. Most non-XML implementations distinguish between arrays and singular elements, so it's beneficial to precalculate this distinction.
* _**Clear Implementation Semantics**_\
  FHIR Schema offers clear semantics for implementing FHIR validation rules. This clarity can make it easier for developers to create robust and reliable FHIR implementations.
* _**Source of metadata**_\
  This is essential for FHIRPath, CQL, and code-generation.

In summary, FHIR Schema is a format that aims to make FHIR more accessible and easier to work with for developers, potentially leading to improved interoperability of healthcare systems.
