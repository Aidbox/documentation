# Design form in Aidbox Form IDE

* Open  [http://localhost:8080/ ](http://localhost:8080/), using login / passwod  - admin / admin
* Go to forms by pressing the button `Forms` (or by visiting [http://localhost:8080/ui/sdc](http://localhost:8080/ui/sdc) )
* Go to the `Forms & Workflows` page
* Press on `Create Form` button

You have two options available:

* [Create form from scratch](design-form-in-aidbox-form-ide.md#create-form-from-scratch)
* [Create form from Questionnaire](design-form-in-aidbox-form-ide.md#create-form-from-questionnaire)

## Create form from scratch

* Before creating new form you need to give a form title and namespace
* After that new form template will be generated and you will be redirected to the `Aidbox editor` page
* You need to describe some schemas to complete the form

&#x20;            [Form DSL ](../../../reference/aidbox-forms/form-dsl.md)

&#x20;            [Document DSL](../../../reference/aidbox-forms/document-dsl.md)

&#x20;            [Layout DSL](../../../reference/aidbox-forms/layout-dsl.md)

&#x20;            [Launch DSL](../../../reference/aidbox-forms/launch-dsl.md)

&#x20;            [Finalize DSL](../../../reference/aidbox-forms/finalize-dsl.md)

&#x20;            [FinalizeConstrains DSL](../../../reference/aidbox-forms/finalizeconstraints-dsl.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
Created form will be saved to local file sysem in your repository
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't forget to import the created form into the forms.edn file so that the form is loaded after restarting the program.

Example

```
{ns forms
 import #{forms.vitals
          forms.phq2phq9
          forms.gad-7
          forms.allergies
          forms.ros
          forms.physical-exam
          forms.annual-wellness-visit}
 }
```

## Create form from Questionnaire

* You can import the FHIR Questionnaire file from your local computer or import from json
* After that new form will be generated and you will be redirected to the `Aidbox editor` page
* You can customize the form and all changes will be saved to the local file system in you repository

{% hint style="info" %}
While converting FHIR Questionnaire to the Aidbox form basic extractions will be generated by default
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
