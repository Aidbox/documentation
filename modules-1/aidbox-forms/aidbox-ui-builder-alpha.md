# Aidbox UI Builder (alpha)



## Overview



{% hint style="info" %}
Aidbox UI builder is the tool for creating form without a code. You just sketch out the logical structure of the form and immediately it is rendered and you can test it.
{% endhint %}

This tool is based on the [FHIR SDC Implementation Guide ](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/index.html)which describes how to collect data using FHIR Questionnaire and FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resources.

In FHIR, forms are represented using the [Questionnaire](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaire.html) resource and completed forms are represented using the [QuestionnaireResponse](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaireresponse.html) resource.&#x20;
