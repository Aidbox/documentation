# Form Settings

## General Form Settings

In the UI builder interface, users can set general settings for the form. These settings can be accessed in two ways:

* When users navigate to the UI builder page, they are presented with options to set general settings for the form.
*   Users can also access the general settings for the form by clicking on the name of the form in the form outline. This action opens a sidebar where users can modify the form's general settings.



These settings include:

### ID

The logical id of the form (Questionnaire resource), as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
When saving the form, Aidbox check the id for uniqueness
{% endhint %}

### Form Title





### URL





### Version





### Status





### Launch Context
