description: FHIR versions support
---

Aidbox Forms module supports FHIR versions 4.0.0 to 5.0.0.
FHIR version used is taken from the Aidbox. (Data can be stored only on that version)

However, you can load/import questionnaires with FHIR versions ranging from 3.0.0 to 5.x. 
Our module automatically checks the Questionnaire version and handles conversion as needed.
