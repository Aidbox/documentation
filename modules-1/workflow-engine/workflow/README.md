# Workflow

## Introduction

Workflow allows orchestrating a series of [tasks](../task/). Workflow in Aidbox is implemented through a special [decision](../task/aidbox-predefined-tasks.md#decision-task) task, an instance of which is created on every event of workflow, thus a logic behind workflow could be implemented as an executor for this task.

We plan to add SDK for different programming languages to allow the implementation of workflow as a code on the client side. Also, we plan to introduce DSL to describe simple workflow inside Aidbox Configuration Project.&#x20;

### Workflow API
