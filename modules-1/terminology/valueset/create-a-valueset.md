# Create a ValueSet

There are two ways to get a ValueSet resource in Aidbox:

* [FHIR CRUD API](../../../terminology/valueset/#crud). This way is described by the FHIR spec, good for testing, but may not be suitable for larger value sets or replicating the same configuration on different instances.&#x20;
* [A terminology bundle import](../../../terminology/terminology-api/). Aidbox offers a set of bulk import APIs for Aidbox run-time import and Aidbox start configuration.
