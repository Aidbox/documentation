## July 2021 - v:2107

* We've released a major Aidbox UI upgrade

![New Aidbox UI](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (10).png>)

* Updated REST Console (check out[ the tutorial](https://bit.ly/rest\_console\_tutorial)):
  * Explicit request headers `content-type, accept` etc
  * Show raw response
  * Added syntax highlight
* Upgrade Aidbox Java version to 16.
* Added `user.email`, `user.name` to the User grid to improve UX. [#397](https://github.com/Aidbox/Issues/issues/397).
* Improved logging.
  * Reviewed and updated log event schema. The updated schema is available [here](https://docs.aidbox.app/core-modules/logging-and-audit#logs-schema).
  * Add w\_r - templated request URL for better aggregation. For example, requests like `GET /Patient/pt-1` will become `GET /Patient/?` thus allowing aggregate all read requests for monitoring.
  * Log additional DB metrics from Aidbox.Dev.
  * Added ELK, Kibana, and Grafana to Aidbox image. So now you can start exploring and analyzing logs from scratch. Check our tutorial on exploring and visualizing logs [here](https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development-guides/tutorials/how-to-explore-and-visualize-aidbox-logs-with-kibana-and-grafana).
* We added a new auth mechanism for authorization Aidbox.Cloud and Aidbox.Multibox users by JWT.

You can use **/\[resourceType]/$dump-csv** endpoint to generate CSV file in which JSON resource structure is flattened into comma-separated format. Such an option for data export is useful for integrations with external EHR systems.
* Added support for [If-Match header](https://docs.aidbox.app/api-1/api/crud-1/delete) in DELETE operation of FHIR REST API. If-Match is most often used to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource (i.e., to prevent the "lost update" problem).
* Added support for additional mime types according to the [FHIR specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#mime-type) Accept: _application/fhir+json_, Accept: _application/json+fhir._ When one of the headers is specified for your request, the same Content-Type header is returned by Aidbox.
* Implemented integration with [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). Datadog offers cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform which integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, and log management for real-time observability of customers. You can [configure it](https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development-guides/receive-logs-from-your-app/aidbox-logs-and-datadog-integration) as storage for Aidbox logs. The detailed guide on how to use Datadog monitoring capabilities in your Aidbox-based system you can find [here. ](https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development-guides/receive-logs-from-your-app/datadog-guide)This is an easy way to leverage HIPAA-compliant log management SaaS platform to unify logs, metrics, and traces in a single view.

* Fixed a bug with race condition occurring during CRUD operations with If-Match header. Transaction rollback is implemented for the case when concurrent change happens to the resource.
* Fixed a bug in the user management module when a second registration for a deleted user resulted in an error.
