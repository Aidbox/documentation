# Licensing and Support

Aidbox offers developers a smooth path from a tiny digital health app prototype to a country-wide deployment of a global healthcare solution. [Health Samurai](https://www.health-samurai.io/) is always around to make sure that developers get all the necessary support.

## Aidbox Licenses

To start using Aidbox or Multibox visit the [Aidbox user portal](https://aidbox.app/), create a [project ](../overview/aidbox-user-portal/projects.md)and get a [standard license](../overview/aidbox-user-portal/licenses.md). A standard license allows running Aidbox [locally](run-aidbox-locally-with-docker/) or in [Aidbox Sandbox](run-aidbox-in-aidbox-sandbox.md) for 14 days and then can be extended by the Health Samurai team. You can't use it with real healthcare data or PHI (Protected Health Information). But other than that, you can try all the features of Aidbox and decide if Aidbox is a good fit for your digital healthcare solution.&#x20;
