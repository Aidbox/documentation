# Validation

How aidbox validates incoming resources to provide consistency of stored data?

There are three types of validation in aidbox:

* **structure** **validation -**  validates the shape of resource
* **validation by profiles** - validates resources against profiles - set of constraints and rules
* **operation level validation** - apply specific rules for operation payload \(not for resource\)
