# . expressions

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is non-FHIR extension, incompatible with other FHIR servers
{% endhint %}

With parameters started with `.` you can provide exact path for element, optionally provide coercing after `::` using PostgreSQL types and operator after `$`.

```yaml
GET /Patient?.name.0.family=Johnson
=> WHERE resource#>>'{name,0,family}' = 'Jonhnson'

GET /Patient?.name.0.family$contains=Joh
=> WHERE resource#>>'{name,0,family}' ilike '%John%'

GET /Encounter?.start::timestamptz$gt=2015
=> WHERE (resource#>>'{start}')::timestamptz > '2015'

GET /Patient?.contact$isnull=true
=> WHERE resource#>>'{contact}' IS NULL

```
