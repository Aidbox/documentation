# Chained Parameters

For a more accurate search, we can filter by nested fields of related entities. Reference parameters may be "chained" through `.` 

Obtain all **encounters** with patients \(**subject** â€” link to the patient\) with name Alex:

```javascript
GET /Encounter?subject:Patient.name=Alex
```

You can use several chained parameters by base resource:

```javascript
GET /Encounter?part-of:Encounter._id=enc1&subject:Patient._id=patient1
```

"Reversed chaining" is selection of resources based on the properties of resources that refer to them.

Obtain patient resources where encounter has id = enc1 and refer to the patient through subject field:

```javascript
GET /Patient?_has:Encounter:subject:_id=enc1
```
