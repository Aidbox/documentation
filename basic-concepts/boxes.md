# Boxes

If you already have an Aidbox account, then you can create your own boxes. Each box is an instance of FHIR server with a separate database and base URL.

For example, you can create several boxes for development, one box for staging, and another for production.

Boxes can be created from the Dashboard, using REST API, or aidbox-cli util.

We take care of all the maintaining, scaling and updating of your boxes.

Box management is done on the 'Dashboard' page. 

The 'Dashboard' is a place where you can see all your existing boxes, and create, manage, share and destroy boxes. Each box in the Dashboard has a name, an URL where it will be deployed, a list of users the box is shared with, a destroy option and a payment plan indicator.
